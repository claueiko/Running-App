This is my first Full Stack Web App - Project 02 on General Assembly with my cohort mate Rob Sesemann and was built in one week, ending Thursday Sept.15, 2022.

## Technologies
HTML, CSS, jQuery, MongoDB and NodeJS.

## Wins
I didn't think I was into backend (not as much as frontend) and this project helped me fully understand how it works. I have learned so much in the last week, I feel like I can build anything LOL - Of course not. I am very pleased with the results we achieved in one week only.

## Difficulties
Connecting multiple Collections was a bit tricky, as well as using Multer (a dependency for uploading images). I couldn't do it without my instructor's help **Saad Iqbal**. Also, I really like Bootstrap but there was an update while building the app that changed all our styles.

## To do in the future
Redirect users after registering to a new Athlete or Coach add page.
Create a profile page.
