## Wins
I didn't think I was into backend (not as much as frontend) and this project helped me fully understand how it works. I have learned so much in the last week, I feel like I can build anything LOL - Of course not.

## Difficulties
Connecting multiple Collections was a bit tricky, as well as using Multer (a dependency for uploading images). I couldn't do it without my instructor's help **Saad Iqbal**.
