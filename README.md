Corrida is a Web App built for Runners and Coaches.
Runners can add their stats, link their accounts to Coaches and follow their Training Plans.
Coaches can create Training Plans and Add Club Information.
Anyone can Add new Running Events and Sign Up on their website.

This is my Project 02 with General Assembly with my cohort mate Rob Sesemann.
