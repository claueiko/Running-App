## Wins
I have always leaned towards frontend and this project helped me fully understand how  the backend works. I have learned a lot during this project. I am very pleased with the results we achieved in one week only.

## Difficulties
Connecting multiple many-to-many Collections was a bit tricky, as well as using Multer (a dependency for uploading images). Also, I really like Bootstrap but there was an update while building the app that changed all our styles.

## Future Enhancements 
Redirect users after registering to a new Athlete or Coach add page.
Create a user profile page. Make it responsive.
